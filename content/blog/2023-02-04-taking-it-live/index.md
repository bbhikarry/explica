Eleven years ago, I was fiddling with a variation on the Sterling engine - deploying magnets to drive a flywheel for a pump motor powering a saltwater aquarium. At some point it occurred to me it might make more sense to scale the idea up. Power filter the Bon Accord Lagoon and do my community some good should it work.

The journey to present has been fun that is to say, innovative and quite possibly useful as a climate resilience tool. I get it, explanations are needed. Stay with me.
